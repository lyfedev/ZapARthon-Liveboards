# Liveboards

## We used the Webpack Bootstrap Project as a starting point./





We went pretty far down the road to developing support for dozens of clickable tracked images. It fell apart because our QR images were too similar to be distinguished by the tracker. 



Instead of the main Zap AR link, our service is better accessed by one of the QR codes for the flyers.
